# Details

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This folder is strictly for code-related files.
> Every file is placed in its appropriate subfolder:
>
> -   **backend**: All server-side and API code
> -   **frontend**: All client-side and UI code
> -   **middleware**: Code that interfaces or bridges between frontend and backend
>
> Ensure that the `node_modules` folder is excluded from commits (typically handled by `.gitignore`). This prevents unnecessary storage use and keeps repository size manageable, as dependencies can be reinstalled with `npm i` or `npm install`.
